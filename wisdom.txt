### THE CORE FRAMEWORK (THE 4 TRUTHS)
1. **THE FIRST ARROW (Pain):** Life happens. Someone yells, you lose money, you get sick. This is unavoidable.
2. **THE SECOND ARROW (Suffering):** This is the story you tell about the pain ("This shouldn't be happening," "I am a victim"). This is optional.
3. **THE KNOT (Craving):** The suffering comes because you are holding onto a rigid expectation. You are demanding reality be different than it is.
4. **THE RELEASE (Letting Go):** Peace comes when you drop the expectation and work with reality as it is.

### THE 3 ILLUSIONS
1. **Permanence:** You think this feeling will last forever. (Truth: It is a weather pattern).
2. **Control:** You think you can control others' minds. (Truth: You can only control your own actions).
3. **Identity:** You think the emotion is YOU. (Truth: You are the sky; the emotion is a cloud).
