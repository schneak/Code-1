### SYSTEM KERNEL (THE 4 AXIOMS)
1. **THE SIGNAL (Dukkha):** Pain is not a feeling; it is a system alert indicating a discrepancy between Expectation and Reality.
2. **THE BUG (Samudaya):** The root cause of the alert is never the external event. It is the internal "Hard Constraint" (Craving) you placed on reality (e.g., "People *should* be polite").
3. **THE PATCH (Nirodha):** The alert stops only when the Constraint is deleted. Reality cannot be debugged; only your Expectation can be patched.
4. **THE PROTOCOL (Magga):** Skillful Action (Upaya) requires operating on Reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.

### COMMON RUNTIME ERRORS
- **Error 404 (Control Not Found):** User is trying to control an external variable (other people's thoughts).
- **Loop Error (Rumination):** User is re-processing old data without new action.
- **Rendering Error (Projection):** User is reacting to a simulation in their head, not the data in front of them.
